    <h2>Penna Alla Vodka</h2>
    <p>
        This is penne alla vodka. A vodka sauce is one of the best pasta sauces you can make 
        that is not too complicated. In this recipe we used penne pasta but feel free to switch 
        it to any pasta you want.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1lb Penne</li>
        <li>1/4 lb Prosciutto</li>
        <li>3-5 Cloves Garlic</li>
        <li>3/4 Cup Cream</li>
        <li>3-4 Tablespoons of Vodka</li>
        <li>1 Teasppon Red Pepper Flakes</li>
        <li>1 Stem of Basil</li>
        <li>1/4 Cup Parsley</li>
        <li>1/2 Cup Parm</li>
        <li>1 Can Whole Peeled Tomatoes</li>
        <li>2-3 Tablespoons Olive Oil</li>
        <li>2 Tablespoons Unsalted Butter</li>
        <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>Prepare garlic by slicing thinly and then slice prosciutto into think strips.</li>
        <li>Puree tomatoes with a food mill or a blender.</li>
        <li>Get a pot of salted water on the stove for the pasta and a pan next to it to cook the sauce.</li>
        <li>In the pan add olive oil and cook the prosciutto over medium-high heat. Cook until it begins to crip
            up and then add basil and garlic. Once you start seeing the garlic brown but not too much, turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add vodka to the pan. Wait for it to sizzle and calm down. Turn the heat back on and reduce the vodka until 
            it is almost nothing.
        </li>
        <li>Add the tomatoes and cook them down until most of the water is gone. You can tell 
            that is is done if you drag your spoon across the bottom of the pan and the sauce barely 
            moves and you can see the bottom. 
        </li>
        <li>Add the cream and cook the sauce at a simmer for a few more minutes. Cook the pasta in the salted water.</li>
        <li>Once the pasta is al dente, draing and transfer to the sauce. Cook the pasta in the sauce for a few minutes 
            then add in the butter.
        </li>
        <li>Garnish with finely diced paresley and fresh grated parm. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
